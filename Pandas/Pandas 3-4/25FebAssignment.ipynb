    "**Q2.** What is the difference between the functions loc and iloc in pandas.DataFrame?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions `loc` and `iloc` are both used to access data in a Pandas DataFrame, but they have some key differences in how they handle indexing and slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `loc`: This function is label-based, meaning it uses the row and column labels to access data. It accepts label-based indexing or slicing. The syntax for `loc` is `df.loc[row_label, column_label]`. Here, `row_label` can be a single label, a list of labels, or a boolean array, while `column_label` can be a single label, a list of labels, or a boolean array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `iloc`: This function is integer-based, meaning it uses integer positions to access data. It accepts integer-based indexing or slicing. The syntax for `iloc` is `df.iloc[row_index, column_index]`. Here, `row_index` can be a single integer, a list of integers, or a boolean array, while `column_index` can be a single integer, a list of integers, or a boolean array.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between `loc` and `iloc` is that `loc` uses label-based indexing or slicing, while `iloc` uses integer-based indexing or slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples to illustrate the difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6], 'C': [7, 8, 9]})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using loc\n",
    "print(df.loc[1, 'B'])  # Access the value at row label 1 and column label 'B'\n",

    "# 1    5\n",
    "# 2    6\n",
    "# Name: B, dtype: int64\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using iloc\n",
    "print(df.iloc[1, 1])  # Access the value at row index 1 and column index 1\n",
    "# Output: 5\n",

    "# 2    6\n",
    "# Name: B, dtype: int64\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first set of examples, `df.loc[1, 'B']` accesses the value at row label 1 and column label 'B', which returns 5. Similarly, `df.loc[:, 'B']` accesses all rows of column label 'B'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second set of examples, `df.iloc[1, 1]` accesses the value at row index 1 and column index 1, which also returns 5. Similarly, `df.iloc[:, 1]` accesses all rows of column index 1."

    "\n",
    "In the output of `new_df.iloc[2]`, the index position is '2' and it displays the values for column 'A' and 'B' as 2 and 6, respectively. The index position is based on the original index of the DataFrame before reindexing.\n",

    "\n",
    "In pandas, the \"window functions\" refer to a group of functions that operate on a specified window or subset of data within a pandas DataFrame or Series. These functions allow you to perform calculations and transformations on rolling or expanding windows of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of window functions available in pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rolling Window Functions: These functions operate on a fixed-size sliding window of data. The window moves along the data, and calculations are performed on the data points within each window. Examples of rolling window functions include rolling mean (`rolling().mean()`), rolling sum (`rolling().sum()`), rolling standard deviation (`rolling().std()`), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Expanding Window Functions: These functions operate on an expanding window that grows with each new data point. The calculations are performed on all the data points from the start up to the current point. Examples of expanding window functions include expanding sum (`expanding().sum()`), expanding mean (`expanding().mean()`), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Window Aggregation Functions: These functions calculate an aggregate value based on a specified window of data. They do not return a rolling or expanding window but instead provide a single aggregated value for each window. Examples of window aggregation functions include window sum (`window().sum()`), window mean (`window().mean()`), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Window Transformation Functions: These functions generate a new series or column by applying a transformation on a specified window of data. The transformed values are aligned with the original data points. Examples of window transformation functions include window rank (`window().rank()`), window max (`window().max()`), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "These window functions provide powerful capabilities for analyzing and manipulating time series or sequential data in pandas, allowing you to calculate rolling averages, cumulative sums, rank values, and more. They are particularly useful for tasks such as time series analysis, signal processing, and feature engineering."
