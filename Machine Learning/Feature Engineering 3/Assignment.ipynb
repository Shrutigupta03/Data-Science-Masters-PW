    "\n",
    "Min-Max scaling, also known as normalization, is a technique used in data preprocessing to rescale numerical features to a range between 0 and 1. This is done by subtracting the minimum value of the feature and then dividing by the range of the feature, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Min-Max scaling is:\n",
    "\n",
    "X_scaled = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)\n",
    "\n",
    "where X is a feature value, X_min is the minimum value of that feature, X_max is the maximum value of that feature, and X_scaled is the rescaled value of that feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Min-Max scaling is used to normalize features that have different scales so that they can be more easily compared and interpreted. It is particularly useful in machine learning algorithms that use distance calculations, such as k-nearest neighbors and clustering algorithms, where features with larger scales can have a disproportionate impact on the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example to illustrate how Min-Max scaling is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset of customer orders that includes two numerical features: order total and number of items. The order total ranges from $50 to $500, and the number of items ranges from 1 to 10. We want to use these features to predict whether a customer will return for another order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using these features in a machine learning algorithm, we apply Min-Max scaling to normalize them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Order total: X_scaled = (X - $50) / ($500 - $50)\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of items: X_scaled = (X - 1) / (10 - 1)\n",

    "Q2. What is the Unit Vector technique in feature scaling, and how does it differ from Min-Max scaling?\n",
    "Provide an example to illustrate its application.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u> -\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit Vector scaling, also known as normalization, is another technique used in feature scaling to rescale numerical features. Unlike Min-Max scaling, which scales the feature values to a range between 0 and 1, Unit Vector scaling scales the feature values to have a unit norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "A unit norm means that the vector length of the feature values is equal to 1. This is done by dividing each feature value by the Euclidean norm, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the feature values. This ensures that all feature vectors have the same magnitude, regardless of their original scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Unit Vector scaling is:\n",
    "\n",
    "X_scaled = X / ||X||\n",
    "\n",
    "where X is a feature vector, X_scaled is the rescaled feature vector, and ||X|| is the Euclidean norm of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit Vector scaling is useful when the magnitude of the feature values is not important, but the direction of the feature vectors is important. It is commonly used in text classification and natural language processing, where the magnitude of the word frequencies is not important, but the direction of the word vectors is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example to illustrate how Unit Vector scaling is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset of customer reviews for a restaurant that includes three features: the frequency of the words \"food\", \"service\", and \"atmosphere\" in the reviews. We want to use these features to classify the reviews as positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using these features in a machine learning algorithm, we apply Unit Vector scaling to normalize them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Word frequencies: X_scaled = X / ||X||\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a review has the following word frequencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Food: 10    \n",
    "Service: 5    \n",
    "Atmosphere: 3    \n",

    "\n",
    "Word frequencies: X_scaled = [10, 5, 3] / sqrt(10^2 + 5^2 + 3^2) = [0.8704, 0.4352, 0.2611]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the three features have been rescaled to have a unit norm, and they can be used as a feature vector to classify the reviews as positive or negative, based on their direction in the three-dimensional space.\n"

    "Q3. What is PCA (Principle Component Analysis), and how is it used in dimensionality reduction? Provide an\n",
    "example to illustrate its application.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u> -\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used in data analysis and machine learning to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset. It does this by identifying the most important patterns in the data and transforming the original variables into a new set of variables, known as principal components, that capture most of the variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA works by finding linear combinations of the original variables that maximize the variance in the data. These linear combinations are called principal components, and they are orthogonal to each other, meaning they are uncorrelated. The first principal component captures the most variance in the data, and each subsequent principal component captures the next highest variance, subject to the constraint that it is orthogonal to all previous principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is used in dimensionality reduction because it allows us to reduce the number of variables in a dataset while retaining most of the important information. This can help improve the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, where the performance decreases as the number of variables increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example to illustrate how PCA is used in dimensionality reduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset of customer reviews for a restaurant that includes ten features, such as the frequency of words like \"food\", \"service\", \"atmosphere\", and so on. We want to use these features to predict whether a customer will return for another visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using these features in a machine learning algorithm, we apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Standardize the data: We first standardize the data by subtracting the mean of each feature and dividing by its standard deviation. This ensures that all features have the same scale and prevents features with larger variances from dominating the principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compute the principal components: We then compute the principal components of the standardized data using the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm. This gives us a new set of variables, where the first principal component captures the most variance in the data, the second principal component captures the next highest variance, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select the number of principal components: We select the number of principal components to retain based on the amount of variance they capture. A common rule of thumb is to retain enough principal components to capture at least 80% of the variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that we find that the first three principal components capture 85% of the variance in the data. We can then use these three principal components as our new features in a machine learning algorithm, instead of the original ten features. This reduces the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of the important information."
